2. Fix Your First Bug

The combat system in Fantasy Quest isn't working as intended! It appears that players are gaining health when attacked instead of losing it.

Assignments:

```python
sword_damage = 10
start_health = 100
end_health = start_health + sword_damage

# Don't touch below this line
print(f"Sam's health is: {start_health}")
print(f"Sam takes {sword_damage} damage...")
print(f"Sam's health is: {end_health}")
```
Fixed Code âœ…:

```python
sword_damage = 10
start_health = 100
end_health = start_health - sword_damage

# Don't touch below this line
print(f"Sam's health is: {start_health}")
print(f"Sam takes {sword_damage} damage...")
print(f"Sam's health is: {end_health}")
```

3. The Console

The console is a place where you can see the output of your code.

```python
print("Hello, Welcome to Learn Python!")
```
Output after running the code:

```
Hello, Welcome to Learn Python!

```
